Basic Game Rules:
-----------------

* Huntercoin is a game played within the blockchain, blocks and game turns are the same.
  Players can create one or many characters (hunters) to collect coins and fight each other
  on single map with a size of 502x502 tiles.

* Each Hunter is member of a team. 4 teams exist: Yellow, Red, Green and Blue. Hunters can't kill hunters from same team.

* Hunters can "destruct" to kill enemy hunters on adjacent tiles. Loot from killed hunters is dropped to the ground.

* Destruct does several things:
  It absorbs life energy (measured in HUC) from the victim(s).
  It defends against being destructed by hostile hunters (reliably even against multiple foes)
  However, sending destruct will also render yourself defenseless for a short time,
  because transactions need a certain time to confirm. Timing is important.

* Hunters can pick up the "Crown of Fortune", which yields 0.25 coins per block. Upon reaching a bank,
  this item returns to a random place on the map. While holding the crown, the hunter can't destruct.  

* Sooner or later, hunters need to find a "bank". Doing so will convert their collected loot to HUC,
  which are sent to the player's wallet.

* Staying at the bank tile allows hunters to logout, and their value is refunded and sent to the player's wallet.


Life-Steal Fork: (Block 795000 - 1521499)
-----------------------------------------

* Game fee of 20 HUC for destruct and 5 HUC (in addition
  to the 200 HUC locked in the hunter) for spawning hunters.

* Carrying capacity lowered to 100 HUC (crown holder is still exempt).

* Death on a bank (logout and refund) happens now after 2 blocks, not 30 as before.

* Hearts never spawn.

* At the fork, all hearts are removed and all hearted characters
  killed immediately.  Coins are handled as per disaster death.

* Death by disaster now refunds the general cost.  The collected coins
  are added to the game fund (minus miner tax).

* Destructing is not lethal for the hunter itself.

* Waypoints and destruct can be set at once in a valid move.

* Use life-steal to handle destructs.  In particular:
  1) Mutual attacks of a pair of hunters are considered "void" and not
     processed at all.  Kind of like a "defense".
  2) Hunters with at least as many attackers as their current value
     die.  Their coins are dropped on the floor as before (including miner
     tax).  Their value is not part of that.
  3) Each attacker that is still alive gets life from each victim.  If the
     victim has not enough for all alive attackers, this is done randomly.
     If the victim has less than 200 HUC value, this is added to the game fund
     instead.  The same is true if the "rightful owner" (attacker) has died
     itself.

* Spawning of characters (and their initial direction) is now random
  among all walkable tiles.

* Banks are no longer at the corners, but instead randomly placed.
  At the fork height, 75 banks are placed with a random life time
  between 25 and 100 blocks.  Whenever the life time of a bank
  runs out, it is randomly re-created on a fresh walkable tile
  and with a fresh life time.


Timesave fork:  (Block 1521500 and higher)
------------------------------------------

* Players and banks spawn always near coin harvest areas:

 pppppppp
pp......p
p..cccc.p
p.ccccc##       #  unwalkable tile
p.cccccc#p      c  coin harvest tile
p.cccccc.p      .  adjacent tile
p...cccc.p      p  player spawn
ppp......p
  pppppppp

  Banks can spawn on coin harvest tiles 'c' and adjacent tiles '.'

* Logout on bank tile in 1 block (i.e. you can't be on a bank tile and not logout)

* Player spawn tiles work like banks, faster than pre-fork banks (2 blocks until logout).
  If banking on player spawn strip, the Crown of Fortune will remain with this hunter.

* New hunter cost 1 HUC (down from 5)

* Sending "destruct" cost 1 HUC (down from 20)

* Refundable cost of a hunter is halved to 100
  (e.g. if you kill 2 hunters in PvP you will be refunded 100+2*100=300 HUC after logout)

* Hunters are invulnerable after spawn for 5 blocks or until the hunter starts to move (waypoints set).
  Hunters can choose to stand still to become spectator. 
  Spectators are invulnerable and can't move, will automatically logout 15 blocks after becoming one.

* "Ghost coins" every 500 blocks
  Ghost coins appear semi-opaque, hunters can't harvest them
  Schedule: at block 300 out of full 500, every 4th coin
            at block 450 out of full 500, 3 out of 4 coins
            at block 480 out of full 500, all coins
            at block 500, return to normal
  Every "ghosting" event will accumulate about 700 HUC that are released at once when it ends
